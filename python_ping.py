# if you are looking to ping a host multiple times using Python, you can use the subprocess module to run the ping command in a loop. Here is an example of how you can do this:

import subprocess
import time

# Replace "google.com" with the host you want to ping
target = "google.com"

# Set the number of pings to send
num_pings = 10

# Set the interval between pings (in seconds)
interval = 1

# Send the pings
for i in range(num_pings):
    # Run the ping command
    result = subprocess.run(["ping", "-c", "1", target], capture_output=True)

    # Print the output
    print(result.stdout)

    # Wait for the specified interval
    time.sleep(interval)

  
  # This script sends num_pings pings to the specified host, with an interval of interval seconds between each ping. The output of each ping is printed to the console.
